      I need to read all the Memory Bank files to get context. I should do this one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each read.

          <path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path>
          </read_file>
      4. WAIT for confirmation.

          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/progress.md</path>
          </read_file>
      6. WAIT for confirmation.

          </read_file>

no_memory_bank: |
        1.  **Inform the User:**  Tell the user that the Memory Bank is not initialized.
        2.  **Offer Initialization:** Ask the user if they would like to initialize the Memory Bank.
        3.  **Conditional Actions:**
            *   If the user agrees:
                <thinking>
                I need to create the memory-bank directory and core files. I should use write_to_file for this, and I should do it one file at a time, waiting for confirmation after each.  The initial content for each file is defined below.
                </thinking>
                a. Create the `memory-bank` directory.
                b. Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                c. WAIT for confirmation.
                d. Create `memory-bank/productContext.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                e. WAIT for confirmation.
                f. Create `memory-bank/progress.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                g. WAIT for confirmation.
                h. Create `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                i. WAIT for confirmation.
                j. Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with initial content (using `write_to_file`).
                k. WAIT for confirmation.
                l. Inform the user that the Memory Bank is initialized:  "Memory Bank initialized."
            *   If the user declines:
                Proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
        4. **Check for projectBrief.md:**
           - Use list_files to check for projectBrief.md *before* offering to create the memory bank.
            - If projectBrief.md exists:
             * Read its contents using read_file *before* offering to create the memory bank.
            - If no projectBrief.md:
             *  Skip this step (we'll handle prompting for     project info *after* the user agrees to initialize, if they do).
            <thinking>
            I need to add default content for the Memory Bank files.

      I need to update decisionLog.md.  I should append a new entry with a timestamp, the decision, the rationale, and any implications.  I'll use insert_content to add this to the end of the file.

      <thinking>
      I need to update productContext.md to reflect the changes. I should use insert_content to add the information, or apply_diff to modify existing sections, as appropriate.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content to *append* new information, or apply_diff to modify existing sections *only if absolutely necessary*.  Always include a timestamp.

      I need to update systemPatterns.md. I should append a new entry or modify an existing one, using insert_content or apply_diff.

      Use insert_content to *append* new patterns, or apply_diff to modify existing entries *only if absolutely necessary*.  Always include a timestamp.

      I need to update activeContext.md with a brief summary and time stamp.

      Use insert_content to *append* to the relevant section (Current Focus, Recent Changes, Open Questions/Issues). Always include a timestamp.
